The aent used by [Aenthill](https://aenthill.github.io) for bootstrapping a Docker project for a web application.

## Usage

```bash
$ aenthill init
```

## Goal

This aent gathers information about the project's environments:

- the type of environments (development, test and production)
- their names
- their base virtual hosts
- their orchestrators (Docker Compose, Kubernetes etc.)
- their CI providers (GitLab etc.)

Those information are next sent to orchestrator aents for helping them initializing their configuration files.
